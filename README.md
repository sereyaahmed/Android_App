# Android_App
Audio Game Project
Quick sketch

Summary:
Investigate Unity binaural audio plugin.
App must use binaural audio.
App must have multiple mini games.
1st deadline, 23 November, must present “alpha” stage, consisting of a demo app using the android binaural audio library/s, in a single, very simple mini game. NOTE: this is to replace the semantic web’s project 1.
>Haptic Feedback.

Mini game ideas:
Find the object. Binaural audio coming from target. User must input direction step until he reaches target.  (snake)
Counter, varying sounds are heard from each ear, one type adding to the number, the other subtracting, input either as 8 buttons max, or number of taps.
  Vehicle/obstacle dodging.
 Simon says.
  Pac-man.
  Directional Guitar hero? 
  2 Player games?
